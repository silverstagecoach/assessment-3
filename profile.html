        I love to model, and I have been playing Warhammer 40k for a few years. I've been building a Tyranid army, and, to be honest, my painting is abyssmal, so I paid my brother to paint them recently.

        I built my new computer, and I have been enjoying the challenge that it was. Making a new system was difficult, especially since this was really the first time I built my own machine.

        I feel like saying I like to watch YouTube is a cop-out, because most everyone does. I'm trying to become a Google power-user though, and I have been learning how to use the search functions. If you want to learn some too, here's a pretty simple site to explain some of them. <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/">https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/</a>

        Career Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
        At the current moment, my goals are pretty simple: I just want a job so that I can be home more often. My friend is a UX Engineer at Google, and he and I have had many pow-wows about what I should do. He's been gently nudging me to code for years now, and I am glad I have taken his advice. While some of this (CSS in particular) is strenuous, I am glad for it, and I look forward to the change it will bring.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tangents aside, I want to find a stable job where I can have enough money to start traveling the world. I don't have a goal to work for Google or Walmart, or someone in particular presently. I don't want to limit who I am looking at as an employer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Really, I should just have a section about tangents. I feel like I want to become a backend dev at the moment, though I'm not sure where I want to land. I can find happiness in most challenges and I look forward to reaching new heights, and learning to languages.
